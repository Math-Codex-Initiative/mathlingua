# Continuous Functions

If $f(x)$ is a real-valued function, it may behave strangely.
In particular, it may have "holes", places where the
function is not defined, or "gaps", points where there are
sudden jumps in the function`\'`s output.

*Continuous functions*, which we define in this section,
do not have these properties.  However, before defining
what a continuous function is, we need to define the
absolute value function which will be used to measure how
close two real numbers are.
::


[\real.abs(x)]
Defines: f(x)
extending: 'f(x) is \function:on{\real.numbers}:to{\real.numbers}'
expresses:
. piecewise:
  when: 'x is \positive:within{\real.numbers}'
  then: 'f(x) := x'
  else: 'f(x) := \additive.inverse:of{x}:inField{\real.numbers}'
written: "\left | x? \right |"
called: "The Absolute Value of $x?$"

In this section, our definition of a continuous function
will be limited to continuous functions on intervals.

An interval is the set of all numbers between two real
numbers $a$ and $b$.  If neither endpoints are included in
that set, the interval is said to be an *open interval*.

Otherwise, if both endpoints are included in the set, the
interval is said to be a *closed interval*.

We make this definitions precise below.  Note that if an
interval contains one endpoint but not the other, then
it is neither an open interval nor a closed interval, but
we won`\'`t be discussing such intervals here.
::


[\open.interval{a, b}]
Defines: I
extending: 'I is \set'
expresses:
. 'I := \set[x]:where{x in \real.numbers}
               :suchThat{a \real.lt/ x}
                        {x \real.lt/ b}'
written: "(a?, b?)"
called: "The Open Interval from $a?$ to $b?$"


[\closed.interval{a, b}]
Defines: I
extending: 'I is \set'
expresses:
. 'I := \set[x]:where{x in \real.numbers}
               :suchThat{a \real.leq/ x}
                        {x \real.leq/ b}'
written: "[a?, b?]"
called: "The Closed Interval from $a?$ to $b?$"


::
Now we can describe what it means for a function $f(x)$
to be continuous on an open interval $I$ at some point
$c \in I$.

Note that our definition of a continuous function assumes
the function is defined on an open interval.  This restriction
is not needed and what it means for a function to be
continuous can be described for functions whose input set,
or *domain*, is something other than an open interval.

However, since we are only focused on describing the
First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus stating in the
[Introduction](#/content/10_Introduction.math), we will
use the more restrictive definition.
::


[\continuous.function:on{I}:at{c}]
Defines: f(x)
given: a, b
when:
. 'I := \open.interval{a, b}'
. 'c in I'
extending: 'f is \function:on{I}:to{R}'
means:
. 'f(c) = \function.limit[x]_{c}{f(x)}'
using:
. 'R := \real.numbers'
written: "\textrm{Continuous Function on } I? \textrm{ at } c?"


::
Now that we have defined what it means for a function to
be continuous at a point, we can define what it means for
a function to be continuous on an entire set.
::


[\continuous.function:on{I}]
Defines: f(x)
given: a, b
when:
. 'I := \open.interval{a, b}'
extending: 'f is \function:on{I}:to{R}'
means:
. forAll: c
  suchThat: 'c in I'
  then: 'f is \continuous.function:on{I}:at{c}'
using:
. 'R := \real.numbers'
written: "\textrm{Continuous Function on } I?"
